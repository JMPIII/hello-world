# hello-world
This is what the repository guide told me to do.

So here I am doing everything a repository guide tells me to do. I don't know that I like it, but I also don't know that I dislike it. Seems like I'm still typing so there is something that's keeping me from disobeying the repository guide. My conclusion is I like it more than I dislike it.
